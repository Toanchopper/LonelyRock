This is my second mini game I created when staying at home due to covid-19 =))
It's basically a game to kill your time :v Touch and hold to gearing and release to jump. Remember to collect all coin in each level
Anyway,it's only for android at this time,I don't have a mac :(
I hope you like it <3 Thank you!
